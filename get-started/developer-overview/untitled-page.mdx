# **Quickstart**

Get up and running on the latest version of HubSpot’s developer platform.

Get started with app development by building and deploying a simple boilerplate app.

If you don’t have a developer account yet, click [**<u>here</u>**](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/crm?intent=developer&uuid=2de87dec-5d66-431b-9031-0cdde293ac72) to create a new developer account. If you previously created a developer account prior to August 29, 2025, check out [**<u>this guide</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/getting-started/convert-your-account-into-a-developer-crm-account) for details on opting into the new developer platform.[**<u>​</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart#set-up-your-local-environment)

## **Set up your local environment**

Before getting started, install the latest version of the[**<u>HubSpot CLI</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/developer-tooling/local-development/hubspot-cli/install-the-cli). In a terminal window, run the following command:

```shellscript
npm install -g @hubspot/cli && hs init
```

The CLI needs to be version`7.6.0`or later.

- You can check which version of the CLI you have by running `hs --version`.
- If needed, you can run the command `npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest` to update to the latest version of the HubSpot CLI.

The`hs init`command will create a CLI configuration file and authenticate your HubSpot account.

- Follow the prompts to generate a Personal Access Key in your account, then copy and paste it into the terminal to save your configuration.
- It’s recommended that you make this account your default in the CLI.
- You can run `hs account auth` at any time to authenticate a different HubSpot account.
