Get started with app development by building and deploying a simple boilerplate app.

If you don’t have a developer account yet, click [**<u>here</u>**](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/crm?intent=developer&uuid=2de87dec-5d66-431b-9031-0cdde293ac72) to create a new developer account. If you previously created a developer account prior to August 29, 2025, check out [**<u>this guide</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/getting-started/convert-your-account-into-a-developer-crm-account) for details on opting into the new developer platform.[**<u>​</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart#set-up-your-local-environment)

## **Set up your local environment**

Before getting started, install the latest version of the[**<u>HubSpot CLI</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/developer-tooling/local-development/hubspot-cli/install-the-cli). In a terminal window, run the following command:

```shellscript
npm install -g @hubspot/cli && hs init
```

The CLI needs to be version`7.6.0`or later.

- You can check which version of the CLI you have by running `hs --version`.
- If needed, you can run the command `npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest` to update to the latest version of the HubSpot CLI.

The`hs init`command will create a CLI configuration file and authenticate your HubSpot account.

- Follow the prompts to generate a Personal Access Key in your account, then copy and paste it into the terminal to save your configuration.
- It’s recommended that you make this account your default in the CLI.
- You can run `hs account auth` at any time to authenticate a different HubSpot account.

## **Create and upload a project**

**1**

**Get started**

With the CLI installed, run `hs get-started` to initialize your project.

```shellscript
hs get-started
```

**2**

**Configure your project details**

You’ll then be greeted with a welcome message, and you can begin setting up your project and app.

- Following the prompts, select **App**.

  ![Image](/images/image-18.png)
- Give your project a **name**.
- Set your project’s **local directory** (by default this will be your current working directory).
- Upload your project to HubSpot to initialize the first build and deploy.

  ![Image](/images/image-21.png)
- You’ll then be prompted to install dependencies and upload your project. Installing dependencies before uploading ensures a faster build of the included app card, and makes sure that your local development environment and production match. This step will add a `package-lock.json` file and Node modules directory to the project’s `cards/` directory.
- Then, confirm that you want to upload your project to your account.

## **Install and preview your app**

**1**

**Install your app**

After your project deploys, you’ll be prompted to navigate to your HubSpot account to walk through installing and previewing your app.

- In the terminal, confirm that you want to open your account. A browser window will open the project details page in HubSpot.
- On the project details page, click **Install now** to install the app. You’ll then be taken to the app install page.

  ![Image](/images/image-22.png)
- On the app install page, click **Connect App** to install the app in your account.
- A confirmation message will appear once the app successfully installs. You can then close the page or click **return home**.

At any time, you can return to the project details page either through the terminal or in HubSpot:

- In the terminal, run `hs project open` while in the local project directory.
- In HubSpot, navigate to **Development** in the main navigation bar, then locate your project under _Recently updated projects_ or through the left sidebar.

**2**

**Start local development**

With the project uploaded and installed, you can start the local development server to preview your app card.

- In the terminal, navigate into your project directory, then run `hs project dev`.

As of [**<u>Google Chrome version 142</u>**](https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/142#local_network_access_restrictions), you will receive a one time time popup asking for [_app.hubspot.com_](http://app.hubspot.com) to access devices on your local network. Select **Accept** to enable local development for your apps.\
\
You can also manage this setting in your Chrome settings by navigating to **Settings** \> **Privacy & Security** \> [**app.hubspot.com**](http://app.hubspot.com) \> **Permissions** \> **Local network access**.

- When prompted, select the account you want to test in.
  - To test in a developer test account within your production account (recommended), select **Test on a developer test account**.
  - Select an existing test account, or select **Test on a new developer test account**. Then, follow the prompts to install the app in the test account.

For more advanced testing, you can create [**<u>configurable test accounts</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/developer-tooling/local-development/configurable-test-accounts), which can be assigned specific combinations of HubSpot subscription tiers to ensure feature compatibility.

- The local development server will then start, and the terminal will provide a link to view the local dev session in HubSpot. Follow the link to open the HubSpot local development page in your account.

**3**

**Setup local development preview**

Before you can preview the app card on the contact record, you’ll need to add your new card to the contact record view.

- On the local development page, click **Setup preview**. You’ll then be redirected to the contacts index page.

  ![Image](/images/image-23.png)
- Click the **name** of a contact record.
- At the top of the middle column of the contact record, click **Customize**.
- Click **Default view**.
- Select the **tab** that you want to add the card to. You can then hover over the location where you want to place the card and click the **plus button**. This can be adjusted at any time after initial setup.

  ![Image](/images/image-24.png)
- In the right sidebar, click the **Card library** tab. Then, click the **Card types** dropdown menu and select **App** to filter for app cards.
- Click **Add card** under the app card you created, then click the **close** button in the top right of the sidebar.
- In the top right, click **Save and exit**.

  You’ll then be redirected back to the contact record, and the app card will display with a`Developing locally`tag to indicate that the local development server is waiting to detect local changes.

  ![Image](/images/image-25.png)

You will not need to repeat the preview setup steps moving forward, unless you want to change the position of the card or customize another CRM record view.

**4**

**Continue local development**

While the local development server runs, it will automatically pick up on any changes saved to the app card’s front-end React file. If you need to make changes to other file types, such as a `.json` configuration file, you’ll need to reupload the project and restart the local development [server.To](http://server.To) test this out, make a change to the app card’s local `.jsx` React file, then save your change. For example, change the text within one of the `Text` [**<u>components</u>**](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/add-features/ui-extensibility/ui-components/standard-components/text).
